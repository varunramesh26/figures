# Figures API Refernce

*NOTE: The API is in pre-production development and subject to change*

## Overview

This doc is a starting point to provide infomration on the REST APIs either defined in Figures or used by Figures.

The initial goal is to provide a reference for front end development.


## Figures REST API

These are endpoints provided by Figures

We will add a version number in the path

### Courses Index

```
/figures/api/courses-index/
```

This provides a list of abbreviated course details. Example:


```
[
	{"id":"course-v1:edX+DemoX+Demo_Course","name":"edX Demonstration Course","org":"edX","number":"DemoX"},
	{"id":"course-v1:WoodWorksU+WW101+2018","name":"Introduction to Woodworking","org":"WoodWorksU","number":"WW101"},
	{"id":"course-v1:WoodWorksU+WW102+2018","name":"Introduction to Hand Tools","org":"WoodWorksU","number":"WW102"}
]
```

Results can be filtered with query parameters. Examples:

To get a list of courses for a specific organization:

```
/figures/api/courses-index/?org=edX
```

To find all courses that contain 'Introduction':

```
/figures/api/courses-index/?display_name='Introduction'
```

Please see the [CourseOverviewFilter](https://github.com/appsembler/figures/blob/master/figures/filters.py#L15) class which defines filters available.

### Users Index

```
/figures/api/user-index/
```

This provides a list of abbreviated user data. Example:

```
[
	{"id":20,"username":"miles","fullname":"Miles Davis"},
	{"id":21,"username":"dsanborn","fullname":"David Sanborn"},
	{"id":22,"username":"natelie","fullname":"Natelie Cole"},
]
```

To get a list of active users (exclude innactive users)

```
/figures/api/user-index/?is_active=True
```

As of this time, the query is case sensitive.
